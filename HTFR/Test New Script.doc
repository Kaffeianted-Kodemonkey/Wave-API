          Test New Script WCAG Evaluation

          The How-To-Fix Report outlines issue found through a manual and automated evaluation.

          Do not be alarmed at the size of this document. As you review it the report you may notice that some of the
          issues are notated on multiple pages. If you designed the site using dynamic programming or a templates then once
          you resolve and issue all pages with notating that issue should be resolved.

          Through a Manual Evaluation, our Accessibility Expert will physically review the pages within the site to make
          sure they are Perceivable – Operable – Understandable & Robust.

          Through an automated Evaluation our Accessibility Expert will run each page through our accessibility script
          to analysis the structure of the pages. This will give a deeper analysis if each page and return the number of
          Errors – Alerts – Features – Structural Elements – HTML5 & Aria Constant Errors.

          Please review the instructions below and let our Accessibility Expert know your timeframe for resolution.
          If the timeframe is more than 90 days we can issue a partial Certification allowing you time to resolve issues and
          receive a full certification. 

          Instructions:

          Each page that was evaluated is outlined in this document and depicts the following.

          <ul>
            <li>Errors: indicate accessibility errors that need to be fixed in order to pass a WCAG Certification, there may be some exceptions.</li>
            <li>Alerts: Indicates warnings and should be looked at.</li>
            <li>Features: indicate accessibility features - things that probably improve accessibility (though these should be verified).</li>
            <li>Contrast Errors: Indicates issues with font color and or size against the background color  which can make it hard for some users to read.</li>
            <li>Structural Elements: Outline the layout structure of the page</li>
          </ul>

          Review the elements for each page and check them off as they are completed. At the bottom of each section is an area for your developer to make
          comments, timeframe notations, etc... if an element can not be resolved at this time.

          When you have completed the review return the How-To-Fix document to your Accessibility Expert they well look it over and be in touch with the next
          steps.

          The goal is to eliminate as may of the errors as you can. Alerts will require close scrutiny - they likely represent an end user issue. Other
          elements are to facilitate human analysis of accessibility and structure of the page. We include these so your developer can review them an check that
          they are returning the intended outcome.
