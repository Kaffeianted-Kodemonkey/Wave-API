          KKM Testing WCAG Evaluation

          The How-To-Fix Report outlines issue found through a manual and automated evaluation.

          Do not be alarmed at the size of this document. As you review it the report you may notice that some of the
          issues are notated on multiple pages. If you designed the site using dynamic programming or a templates then once
          you resolve and issue all pages with notating that issue should be resolved.

          Through a Manual Evaluation, our Accessibility Expert will physically review the pages within the site to make
          sure they are Perceivable – Operable – Understandable & Robust.

          Through an automated Evaluation our Accessibility Expert will run each page through our accessibility script
          to analysis the structure of the pages. This will give a deeper analysis if each page and return the number of
          Errors – Alerts – Features – Structural Elements – HTML5 & Aria Constant Errors.

          Please review the instructions below and let our Accessibility Expert know your timeframe for resolution.
          If the timeframe is more than 90 days we can issue a partial Certification allowing you time to resolve issues and
          receive a full certification. 

          Instructions:

          Each page that was evaluated is outlined in this document and depicts the following.

          <ul>
            <li>Errors: indicate accessibility errors that need to be fixed in order to pass a WCAG Certification, there may be some exceptions.</li>
            <li>Alerts: Indicates warnings and should be looked at.</li>
            <li>Features: indicate accessibility features - things that probably improve accessibility (though these should be verified).</li>
            <li>Contrast Errors: Indicates issues with font color and or size against the background color  which can make it hard for some users to read.</li>
            <li>Structural Elements: Outline the layout structure of the page</li>
          </ul>

          Review the elements for each page and check them off as they are completed. At the bottom of each section is an area for your developer to make
          comments, timeframe notations, etc... if an element can not be resolved at this time.

          When you have completed the review return the How-To-Fix document to your Accessibility Expert they well look it over and be in touch with the next
          steps.

          The goal is to eliminate as may of the errors as you can. Alerts will require close scrutiny - they likely represent an end user issue. Other
          elements are to facilitate human analysis of accessibility and structure of the page. We include these so your developer can review them an check that
          they are returning the intended outcome.

                  1-Document language missing
                  What It Means:
                  The language of the document is not identified.

                  Why It Matters:
                  Identifying the language of the page allows screen readers to read the content in the appropriate language. It also facilitates automatic translation of content.

                  How to Fix It:
                  Identify the document language using the &lt;html lang&gt; attribute (e.g., &lt;html lang="en"&gt;).

                  The Algorithm... in English:
                  The &lt;html lang&gt; attribute is missing or is empty.

                  1-Spacer image missing alternative text
                  What It Means:
                  A layout spacer image (which should have null/empty alternative text) does not have an alt attribute.

                  Why It Matters:
                  Spacer images are used to maintain layout. They do not convey content and should be given null/empty alternative text (alt="") so they are not presented to users and are ignored by screen readers.

                  How to Fix It:
                  If the image is a spacer image, give the image null/empty alternative text (alt=""). Alternatively, consider using CSS instead of spacer images to control positioning and layout.

                  The Algorithm... in English:
                  An image is missing an alt attribute and has a width or height of 3 pixels or less or has a file name starting with "spacer.*", "space.*", or "blank.*". 

                  Standards and Guidelines:
                  <ul><li><a href=http://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist#sc1.1.1>1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)</a></li></ul>Location: <ul><li>/BODY[1]/CENTER[1]/SPAN[1]/DIV[1]/DIV[1]/TABLE[1]/TBODY[1]/TR[2]/TD[1]/IMG[1]</li></ul>
                  

                  1-Empty link
                  What It Means:
                  A link contains no text.

                  Why It Matters:
                  If a link contains no text, the function or purpose of the link will not be presented to the user. This can introduce confusion for keyboard and screen reader users.

                  How to Fix It:
                  Remove the empty link or provide text within the link that describes the functionality and/or target of that link.

                  The Algorithm... in English:
                  An anchor element has an href attribute, but contains no text (or only spaces) and no images with alternative text.

                  Standards and Guidelines:

                  1-Missing form label
                  What It Means:
                  A form control does not have a corresponding label.

                  Why It Matters:
                  If a form control does not have a properly associated text label, the function or purpose of that form control may not be presented to screen reader users. Form labels also provide visible descriptions and larger clickable targets for form controls.

                  How to Fix It:
                  If a text label for a form control is visible, use the &lt;label&gt; element to associate it with its respective form control. If there is no visible label, either provide an associated label, add a descriptive title attribute to the form control, or reference the label(s) using aria-labelledby. Labels are not required for image, submit, reset, button, or hidden form controls.

                  The Algorithm... in English:
                  An &lt;input&gt; (except types of image, submit, reset, button, or hidden), &lt;select&gt;, or &lt;textarea&gt; does not have a properly associated label text. A properly associated label is:
<ul>
<li>a &lt;label&gt; element with a for attribute value that is equal to the id of a unique form control
<li>a &lt;label&gt; element that surrounds the form control, does not surround any other form controls, and does not reference another element with its for attribute
<li>a non-empty title attribute, or
<li>a non-empty aria-labelledby attribute.
</ul>

                  1-Missing first level heading
                  What It Means:
                  A page does not have a first level heading.

                  Why It Matters:
                  Headings facilitate page navigation for users of many assistive technologies. They also provide semantic and visual meaning and structure to the document. A first level heading (&lt;h1&gt;) should be present on nearly all pages. It should contain the most important heading on the page (generally the document title).

                  How to Fix It:
                  If the page presents a main heading, place it within an &lt;h1&gt; element. Add other sub-headings as necessary.

                  The Algorithm... in English:
                  A page does not have an &lt;h1&gt; element.

                  1-Redundant title text
                  What It Means:
                  Title attribute text is the same as text or alternative text.

                  Why It Matters:
                  The title attribute value is used to provide advisory information. It typically appears when the users hovers the mouse over an element. The advisory information presented should not be identical to or very similar to the element text or alternative text.

                  How to Fix It:
                  In most cases the title attribute can be removed, otherwise modify it to provide advisory, but not redundant information. Note that the title text may or may not be read by a screen reader and is typically inaccessible to sighted keyboard users. 

                  The Algorithm... in English:
                  A title attribute value is identical to element text or image alternative text.

                  Standards and Guidelines:
                  <ul></ul>Location: <ul><li>/BODY[1]/CENTER[1]/DIV[1]/A[1]/IMG[1]</li></ul>
                  

                  1-Unlabeled form element with title
                  What It Means:
                  A form control does not have a label, but has a title.

                  Why It Matters:
                  The title attribute value for unlabeled form controls will be presented to screen reader users. However, a properly associated text label provides better usability and accessibility and should be used unless the purpose of the form control is intuitive without the label.

                  How to Fix It:
                  If a visible text label is available for the form control, associate the text label to the form control using the label element. This provides additional functionality for end users because if the label is clicked it will set focus to the form control. If the form control is intuitive without a &lt;label&gt;, the title attribute value may be used. Note that the title attribute value will not generally be read by a screen reader if the control has a label and may not be available to sighted users, particularly keyboard-only users.

                  The Algorithm... in English:
                  An &lt;input&gt; (except types of image, submit, reset, button, or hidden), &lt;textarea&gt;, or &lt;select&gt; element has a non-empty title attribute value and is missing a label or valid aria-labelledby reference.

                  1-Suspicious link text
                  What It Means:
                  Link text contains extraneous text or may not make sense out of context.

                  Why It Matters:
                  Links, which are often read out of context, should clearly describe the destination or function of the link. Ambiguous text, text that does not make sense out of context, and extraneous text (such as "click here") can cause confusion and should be avoided.

                  How to Fix It:
                  Where appropriate, reword the link text so that it is more descriptive of its destination when read out of context. Remove any extraneous text (such as "click here").

                  The Algorithm... in English:
                  A link (including alt text of linked images) contains the phrase "click here" or "click", or the link text is "click here", "here", "more", "more...", "details", "more details", "link", "this page", "continue", "continue reading", "read more", or "button".

                  Standards and Guidelines:

                  1-Skipped heading level
                  What It Means:
                  A heading level is skipped.

                  Why It Matters:
                  Headings provide document structure and facilitate keyboard navigation by users of assistive technology. These users may be confused or experience difficulty navigating when heading levels are skipped.

                  How to Fix It:
                  Restructure the document headings to ensure that heading levels are not skipped.

                  The Algorithm... in English:
                  A heading level is skipped (e.g., an &lt;h1&gt; is followed by an &lt;h3&gt;, with no intermediate &lt;h2&gt;). Note that an &lt;h1&gt; is not required to be the first heading within the document.

                  1-Linked image with alternative text
                  What It Means:
                  Alternative text is present for an image that is within a link.

                  Why It Matters:
                  Including appropriate alternative text on an image within a link ensures that the function and purpose of the link and the content of the image is available to screen reader users or when images are unavailable.

                  How to Fix It:
                  Ensure that the alternative text presents the content of the image and/or the function of the link. If the full content and function of the link is presented in text within the link (an image and a text caption both within the same link, for example), then the image should generally be given empty/null alternative text (alt="") to avoid redundancy.

                  The Algorithm... in English:
                  An image element has non-empty alternative text, is within a link, and no other text (or images with alternative text) is present within the link.

                  3-Layout table
                  What It Means:
                  A layout table is present.

                  Why It Matters:
                  While tables are primarily intended for the presentation of tabular information or data, they are often used to control page layout and formatting. Layout tables can introduce reading and navigation order issues and must not contain header (&lt;th&gt;) cells.

                  How to Fix It:
                  Ensure that the table is indeed a layout table and that it does not contain tabular data. If it is a data table, provide appropriate header (&lt;th&gt;) cells. Verify that the reading and navigation order of table content (based on underlying source code order) is logical.

                  The Algorithm... in English:
                  A &lt;table&gt; element is present that does not contain any header (&lt;th&gt;) cells.

                  1-Ordered list
                  What It Means:
                  An ordered (numbered) list (&lt;ol&gt; element) is present.

                  Why It Matters:
                  Ordered lists present a group of related sequential items. Users of assistive technologies can navigate by and within lists.

                  How to Fix It:
                  Ensure that an ordered (numbered) list is appropriate for the context. If list items are parallel or the order of the items is not important, an unordered list (&lt;ul&gt;) is likely more appropriate.

                  The Algorithm... in English:
                  An &lt;ol&gt; element is present.

                  What It Means:
                  A second level heading (&lt;h2&gt; element) is present.

                  Why It Matters:
                  Headings facilitate page navigation for users of assistive technologies. They also provide semantic and visual meaning and structure to the document.

                  How to Fix It:
                  Ensure that the text in question is truly a heading and that it is structured correctly in the page outline.

                  The Algorithm... in English:

                  1-Inline Frame
                  What It Means:
                  An inline frame (&lt;iframe&gt;) is present. 	

                  Why It Matters:
                  The content of an inline frame is read as if it were part of the page that contains it. The content of the iframe must be accessible. A title attribute value for the iframe will generally be read by a screen reader when the iframe is encountered.

                  How to Fix It:
                  Ensure that the content within the iframe is accessible. Optionally, a title attribute value can be added to provide a brief, advisory description of the iframe.

                  4-ARIA
                  What It Means:
                  An ARIA role, state, or property is present.

                  Why It Matters:
                  ARIA provides enhanced semantics and accessibility for web content.

                  How to Fix It:
                  Ensure the ARIA role, state, or property is used correctly. Use standard HTML accessibility features when possible. Be aware that support for ARIA is limited in older browsers and assistive technologies.

                  The Algorithm... in English:
                  An ARIA role, state, or property is present, excluding landmark roles, aria-labelledby, or aria-describedby which are distinct WAVE items.

                Contrast Errors-2
                  

                  2-Very Low Contrast
                  What It Means:
                  Very low contrast between foreground and background colors.

                  Why It Matters:
                  Adequate contrast is necessary for all users, especially users with low vision.

                  How to Fix It:
                  Increase the contrast between the foreground (text) color and the background color. Large text (larger than 18 point or 14 point bold) does not require as much contrast as smaller text.

                  The Algorithm... in English:
                  Text is present that has a contrast ratio less than 4.5:1, or large text (larger than 18 point or 14 point bold) has a contrast ratio less than 3:1. Elements with background images must have a background color defined that provides adequate contrast when images are disabled or unavailable.
